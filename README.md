## Web Scraping and Linear Regression: Prediction of Used Vehicle Value Based on KBB Data 

Project timeline: two weeks; final presentation is posted [coming soon]()

### Introduction

Vehicles are important tools that allow flexibly in our lives. We can go shopping any time when stores are  open regardless of weather. We can also drive from east coast to west coast of the US. My friend did so and that was an amazing trip said him. He saw many beautiful natural scenes. While our lives are facilitated by vehicles, you may want to ask yourself the questions below:

- How can I choose a car? 
- What year, make and model?
- What features of a car should I focus on?
- Should I buy a brand new or used car?
- If I buy a new car, how does it depreciate? or If I buy a used car, how does it preserve value?

Here, I would suggest purchasing a used car, as it is justified by the following reasons:

1) Less money & less sticker shock; 2) Less depreciation; 3) Today's long liability; 4) Certified pre-owned programs; 5) Detailed history reports; 6) financing with reduced rate; 7) Lower insurance rate 

Therefore, in this project I will address some of the questions raised above via a machine learning approach. First, the vehicle data and listed price will be scraped from Kelley Blue Book. Next, a feature analysis will be performed to determined what features of a vehicle will be used as input variables in the analysis. Finally, a linear regression model will be trained using these features with respect to the listed price, which would demonstrate the relationship between these features and the listed price. This provides a clear understanding of how to choose a second hand car and how to plan the budget.
